				<li class="rscadd">Codex entries can now include a list of various click and item interactions. These still have to be manually written, but are nicely formatted as a list and includes interactions provided by parent types.

				<li class="bugfix">Table deconstruction steps can now be performed on disarm or grab intent. Harm intent will still attack the table, and help intent will still place items on the table.</li>
